    <h2>pan seared steak</h2>
    <p>This 20-minute recipe is done on the stovetop in one pan (no need to finish it in the oven).
        <br>
        That garlic butter is lip-smacking good! </p>
  
  
 <h3>ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>2 New York Strip Steaks</li>
       <li>herbs and spices(mainly salt and pepper)</li>
       <li>butter</li>
       <li>garlic</li>
     
   </ul>
   <h3>steps</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter</li>
       <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper</li>
       <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter</li>
       <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge)</li>
       <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness</li>
       <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain</li>
    </ol>
